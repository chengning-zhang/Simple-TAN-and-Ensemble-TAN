# Incorporating Contact Matrix Information Using Bayesian Network Into Protein Sequence Analysis 

## Abstract:
In biological systems engineering, unlike the heavy workload of generating millions of biological sequences from a library for a protein or enzyme, contact matrix, which shows the physical touching within and between blocks in the amino acid sequence, is easily accessible . 
However, It is not crystal clear how to leverage the contact matrix to build a classifier for predicting the functionality of proteins from their amino acid sequence. 
In this paper, we present a new approach(simpler TAN) to incorporating the contact matrix based on Bayesian network framework. Theoretical study shows that our new algorithm has substantially improved computational efficiency relative to traditional TAN. In extensive experiments this technique delivers comparable or better prediction performance to NB and TAN in terms of different evaluation metrics. To further improve the classification performance and its stability without sacrificing computational efficiency, We propose another algorithm called Ensemble TAN. Finally, SHAP values are calculated to obtain feature importance scores to help us better understand the model.
